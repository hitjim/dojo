General notes for HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett
===========================================

## Chapter 1 - Structure
### Vocabulary
Element - frequently used to denote an opening and closing tag, along with the content within.

### Notes
Opening tags can carry attribues, which tell us more about the content of that element.  Attributes require a name and value.

## Chapter 2 - Text 
### Vocabulary

### Notes
```html
Tags: <h1>...<h6>, <p>, <b>, <i>, <sup>, <sub>, <br />, <hr /> horizontal rule 
```
Semantic markup doesn't affect structure; adds info to pages
